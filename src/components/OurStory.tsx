          BTreasury was founded in Melbourne by <strong>Carri</strong> and <strong>Chris</strong>, two self‑confessed finance and technology nerds who wanted to cut through the noise surrounding Bitcoin. After decades of coaching Australia's top executives and careful personal Bitcoin investing, they realised that many people—especially women over 35—were curious about Bitcoin but didn't know where to turn for trustworthy guidance. BTreasury exists to be that reasonable voice in the room, helping you understand Bitcoin's role in the changing face of money.

          Carri and Chris are fiercely local and personal. They run workshops in Melbourne to build trust through human connection and to ensure every client feels heard. This emphasis on local presence and genuine relationships underpins the way BTreasury delivers education.
