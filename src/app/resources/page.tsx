    {
      question: "What is hard money vs soft money?",
      answer: "Hard does not refer to its physical property. Hard refers to how difficult it is to create that form of money. That's why typically you'd think of gold as hard money and government money as less hard."
    },
    {
      question: "If Bitcoin was more adopted, wouldn't deflation cause problems? Don't we need some inflation?",
      answer: "There is the fear that having a currency that does not inflate would not allow the economy to grow. This is unfounded. Example: United States after Civil War, prices fell for more than 30 years without stopping growth. Prices fell because growth was robust. Sound money vs inflation targeting: Under gold system, prices are free to fluctuate and better signal resource allocation. Artificially targeting a fixed inflation rate can suppress these signals and often create bubbles. This can also cause a distortion in the market and misallocation of resources, leading to more bubbles. Constantly inflating the currency can inject liquidity into the economy and keep unproductive 'zombie' companies alive. We saw this during the COVID frenzy."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Bitcoin have no intrinsic value?",
      answer: "What is the intrinsic value of government money? Similar to gold, scarcity and network adoption give Bitcoin value. Common to try to fit bitcoin into a cash flow analysis. Bitcoin doesn't do anything, it doesn't earn anything, so we can't value it. Compare more to gold. Bitcoin is valued more for monetary properties than for cash flow."
    },
    {
      question: "How is Bitcoin regulated in Australia?",
      answer: "Bitcoin is not a financial product, it is more akin to a capital asset like property. Different to most other cryptos. Yes there are financial products, like ETFs. They have different trade offs."
    },
    {
      question: "What about Bitcoin's energy consumption and environmental impact?",
      answer: "Current research shows that bitcoin mining uses 52% sustainable energy sources. This trend is continuing. About 0.5% of global electricity, however that's far less than the global banking or gold mining industries. Capturing methane and grid stability for new technologies."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Bitcoin used for crime and illicit activities?",
      answer: "Illicit crypto transactions 0.34% of all crypto activity in 2023. Contrast traditional finance, is about 2-5% of global GDP annually. Bitcoin is a transparent ledger, it's not ideal for criminals as it leaves traces, unlike physical cash."
    },
    {
      question: "What about Bitcoin's transaction speed and scalability?",
      answer: "The base layer priorities security over speed. Visa and Mastercard final settlement 1 month. Bitcoin 10 minutes. Final. Open source, internet protocol, like the TCP IP protocol for the internet, you can build on top of that. And there are layers that are already built to allow for instant transactions. As a store of value, which is probably the predominant use case now, this speed is ok."
    },
    {
      question: "What about Bitcoin's legality and regulation?",
      answer: "Blanket bans are uncommon and often push activity underground. This has no effect on the bitcoin network. Toothpaste is out of the tube. 15 years in."
    },
    {
      question: "What about quantum computing threats to Bitcoin?",
      answer: "It's not a problem today, but it could be one day. Quantum computers might eventually crack the locks that protect Bitcoin, but that's still years away, not tomorrow. Some coins are more at risk than others. The biggest danger is for old or poorly protected coins; people who use fresh addresses each time are much safer. There are fixes ready if needed. The Bitcoin community already has stronger 'locks' we can switch to, but it will take planning and agreementâ€”so the main risk is panic, not the technology itself."
    },
    {
      question: "Can Bitcoin be broken or hacked?",
      answer: "Bitcoin's security comes from its decentralised network and cryptographic proof-of-work system. The network has been running continuously for over 15 years without being compromised. While individual wallets can be vulnerable if not properly secured, the Bitcoin network itself has proven to be extremely resilient against attacks."
