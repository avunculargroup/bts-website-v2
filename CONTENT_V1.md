## About BTS

### Our Story

BTS was founded in Melbourne by **Carri** and **Chris**, two self‑confessed finance and technology nerds who wanted to cut through the noise surrounding Bitcoin. After decades of coaching Australia's top executives and careful personal Bitcoin investing, they realised that many people-especially women over 35-were curious about Bitcoin but didn't know where to turn for trustworthy guidance. BTS exists to be that reasonable voice in the room, helping you understand Bitcoin's role in the changing face of money.

Carri and Chris are fiercely local and personal. They run workshops in Melbourne to build trust through human connection and to ensure every client feels heard. This emphasis on local presence and genuine relationships underpins the way BTS delivers education.

### Mission & Values

Our mission is to make Bitcoin education accessible, practical and grounded in reality. We believe that:

- **Knowledge builds trust:** clear explanations and real‑world examples help investors feel confident.
- **Risk must be understood:** we are risk‑averse by nature but recognise that taking no risk can be riskier; we advocate slow, certain growth.
- **Empowerment over hype:** we do not sell fast fortunes or push products-we teach you to make informed decisions.
- **Holistic perspective:** Bitcoin sits alongside traditional assets as part of a diversified strategy. Understanding personal finance and technology together gives you a complete picture.
- **Fiercely local & personal:** We are a Melbourne business at heart and believe trust is earned through face‑to‑face interactions and transparency. Building relationships with you in person is central to how we work.

### Our Team

- **Carri - Coach & Finance Expert:** With over 20 years in financial services and 20 years coaching executives, Carri has run companies with tight control and knows how personal finances work. She specialises in translating complex topics into clear, actionable steps and has helped countless people feel confident about their finances.
- **Chris - Technologist & Bitcoin Specialist:** Chris brings deep technology expertise and years of careful Bitcoin investing. He follows societal trends and the future of money, applying what he learns to his own family's financial security. Chris's passion is showing how Bitcoin and emerging technologies can complement traditional investments.

Together, Carri and Chris blend business, life, technology, finance and coaching experience to give you a holistic view of Bitcoin and its potential.
